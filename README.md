<h3>A bug-eating snake</h3>
<p> üêûü•¢üêç </p>

<p> Snake || Debugger is a nostalgic arcade game where the player maneuvers a snake to eat food while avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake's body. As the snake grows, the game becomes more challenging.</p>

<p>I am not too fond of snakes or any reptiles. I avoid them at all costs. When doing this project as part of the Web Dev Simplified course, I made it so that it's the only snake I don't hate. </p>

<p>This project was built only with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS &mdash; no libraries, no frameworks. I added score counting and sound to make the game experience feel better.</p>

Play it here: [Snake || Debugger](https://jazellemaira.github.io/snake-game/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> __Arrow Keys:__ Move the snake up, down, left, or right.
>
> There is __NO__ game pausing üôÄ, 
> so make every game count! üò∏‚ú®
